R8.1 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is that you specify a set of public methods and hide the implementation details.
It is useful because other users can use your classed without having to know their implementation.

R8.4 Public interface
Public interface of a class consists of all methods that a user of the class may want to apply to its objects.
The implementation of the methods and the class is invisible by the users.

R8.7 Instance versus static
Instance variable belong to an object of this class.
Static variable belong to class.
Instance methods are invoked on an object.
Static methods are not invoked on an object but a class.

R8.8 Mutator and accessor
A mutator method modifies the object on which it operates.
A accessor method queries the object for some information without changing it.

R8.9 Implicit parameter
The object on which a method is invoked is called the implicit parameter.
Parameters that are explicitly mentioned in the method are called explicit parameters.

R8.10 Implicit parameter
An instance method has one implicit parameter and zero or more explicit parameters.
Static methods do not have implicit parameter.


R8.12 Constructors
A constructor initializes the instance variables of an object.

R8.16 Instance variables
Users can read the class declaration.
However, they can not read or change an instance variable if there is no implementation of public interface for the user to do that.

R8.19 The this reference
This refer to the object itself. It is the implicit parameter. This reference can make your programs easier to read.

R8.20 Zero, null, false, empty String
Null means the value is unknown.
Zero means the value is 0.
False means the boolean value is false.
Empty String is a string with length()=0.
