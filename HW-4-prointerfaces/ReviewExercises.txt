R9.10 Casting
(int)x is primitive data type casting.
byte –> short –> int –> long –> float –> double
Casting primitive data type from a higher one to a lower one might lose information.

(BankAccount)x is reference type casting. It is assigning one Java object to another object.
The two object should have inherit relation.

R9.11 instanceof operator
a.true;
b.true;
c.false;
d.true;
e.true;
f.false;
